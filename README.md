# Sasuke-Advanture Game
## Motivation
* Naruto is my favorite animation, and Sasuke is my favorite character. 
* When I was small, I always imagined myself being Sasuke and did some silly handsigns just to release the cool jutsus as Sasuke did.
* To "become" Sasuke, I decided to create my own pixelated game where I would be Sasuke and performed some silly handsigns to release awesome jutsus.

## Features 
* An AI for NPC to chase and attack the player
* An AI to detect the user's handsigns via webcam to control Sasuke
* Music + Visuals + Score Tracker system 
* Health and Mana system 
## How to Play
* Open the game '.exe' file
* Start the game
* Use W, A, S, D to control Sasuke's movements
* Press E for Sasuke to wing
* When there's enough mana, the player can activate Sharingan by pressing R. Sharingan helps slow down enemies' movements at the cost of reducing mana overtime
* To perform a sequence of 4 handsign:
  * Press C and show 4 handsigns. 
  * For each handsign, show your hand to the laptop's camera for at least 2 seconds before showing a new sign
  * If a valid sequence of handsigns is detected, Sasuke will perform Jutsu (Katon or Chidori)
  * If the sequence is invalid, the screen will display an 'X' symbol
  * If you want to abandone the sequence midway, click C to delete the sequence. Then click C again to show new sequence of handsigns.
